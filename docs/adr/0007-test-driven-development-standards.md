# 0007. Test-Driven Development Standards & Documentation-First Approach
- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2025-01-27

## Context

The Waiver Exchange is a complex, high-performance trading system where correctness, determinism, and performance are critical. Traditional implementation-first approaches have led to:

- **Inconsistent test coverage** across components
- **Documentation drift** from actual implementation
- **Regressions** in critical functionality
- **Performance regressions** in hot paths
- **Difficult debugging** of complex interactions

The Whistle matching engine implementation revealed the importance of comprehensive testing and accurate documentation. We need a systematic approach to ensure:

1. **All critical functionality is thoroughly tested**
2. **Documentation remains the source of truth**
3. **Implementation matches documented specifications**
4. **Performance requirements are validated**
5. **Determinism and replay are guaranteed**

## Decision

**Adopt Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Documentation-First approach for all critical components.**

### TDD Workflow (Mandatory)

All new features must follow this workflow:

1. **Documentation First**
   - Update design docs (`docs/design/`) to reflect new requirements
   - Document expected behavior, inputs, outputs, and edge cases
   - Update ADRs if architectural decisions are needed

2. **Test Planning**
   - Write test specifications before any implementation
   - Define expected inputs, outputs, and behavior
   - Document test scenarios and edge cases
   - Plan integration test requirements

3. **Test Implementation**
   - Write failing tests first (Red phase)
   - Ensure tests capture all documented requirements
   - Include edge cases and error conditions
   - Test both happy path and failure scenarios

4. **Implementation**
   - Write minimal code to make tests pass (Green phase)
   - Refactor while keeping tests green (Refactor phase)
   - Ensure implementation matches documented specifications

5. **Validation**
   - Verify all tests pass
   - Ensure documentation remains accurate
   - Update documentation if implementation reveals new insights

### Test Requirements

**For CRITICAL Components (Whistle, OrderRouter, ExecutionManager):**
- ✅ **Unit tests** for all public APIs
- ✅ **Integration tests** for component interactions
- ✅ **Property-based tests** for invariants (price-time priority, determinism)
- ✅ **Performance tests** for latency/throughput requirements
- ✅ **Replay tests** for determinism validation

**Test Categories:**
1. **Functional Tests** - Verify correct behavior
2. **Invariant Tests** - Verify system invariants (price-time priority, canonical ordering)
3. **Edge Case Tests** - Boundary conditions, error handling
4. **Performance Tests** - Latency/throughput requirements
5. **Determinism Tests** - Replay stability across runs

### Documentation Standards

**Design Documents (`docs/design/`):**
- ✅ **Clear interfaces** with type signatures
- ✅ **Behavioral specifications** with examples
- ✅ **Invariant definitions** and constraints
- ✅ **Error handling** and edge cases
- ✅ **Performance requirements** and SLOs

**Implementation Details:**
- ✅ **Actual behavior** validated by tests
- ✅ **Edge cases** and boundary conditions
- ✅ **Performance characteristics** and limits
- ✅ **Error conditions** and recovery

### Test Documentation Standards

Every test must include:
```rust
#[test]
fn descriptive_test_name() {
    // GIVEN: Setup and preconditions
    let cfg = EngineCfg { /* ... */ };
    let mut eng = Whistle::new(cfg);
    
    // WHEN: Action being tested
    let events = eng.tick(100);
    
    // THEN: Expected outcomes
    assert_eq!(events.len(), 2);
    // ... more assertions
}
```

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

1. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**
   - All critical functionality is tested
   - Edge cases and error conditions are covered
   - Performance requirements are validated
   - Determinism is guaranteed

2. **Accurate Documentation**
   - Documentation reflects actual implementation
   - Examples are validated by tests
   - Interface specifications are tested
   - Behavioral requirements are verified

3. **Reduced Regressions**
   - Tests catch breaking changes
   - Performance regressions are detected
   - Interface changes are validated
   - Determinism violations are caught

4. **Better Design**
   - Test-first approach forces better API design
   - Edge cases are considered early
   - Error handling is planned upfront
   - Performance implications are understood

5. **Easier Maintenance**
   - Tests serve as living documentation
   - Refactoring is safer with test coverage
   - Debugging is easier with test cases
   - Onboarding is faster with test examples

### Negative Consequences

1. **Increased Development Time**
   - Writing tests before implementation takes time
   - Documentation updates require effort
   - Test maintenance adds overhead
   - Initial setup is more complex

2. **Higher Standards**
   - All code must be testable
   - Documentation must be accurate
   - Performance must be validated
   - Determinism must be guaranteed

3. **Learning Curve**
   - Team must learn TDD practices
   - Documentation standards must be followed
   - Test writing skills must be developed
   - Tooling must be understood

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Training & Education**
   - Provide TDD training for the team
   - Document best practices and examples
   - Share lessons learned from Whistle implementation
   - Create test templates and patterns

2. **Tooling & Automation**
   - Automate test execution in CI
   - Provide test coverage reporting
   - Automate documentation validation
   - Create test generation tools

3. **Process & Standards**
   - Enforce TDD workflow in code reviews
   - Require test coverage for critical components
   - Validate documentation accuracy
   - Monitor performance regressions

## Implementation Notes

### Current Status

The Whistle matching engine serves as the **reference implementation** for TDD standards:

- ✅ **36 comprehensive tests** covering all critical functionality
- ✅ **Documentation updated** to reflect actual implementation
- ✅ **Performance requirements** validated by tests
- ✅ **Determinism verified** across multiple runs

### Next Steps

1. **Apply TDD to remaining components**
   - OrderRouter implementation
   - ExecutionManager implementation
   - SymbolCoordinator implementation

2. **Enhance test infrastructure**
   - Property-based testing framework
   - Performance benchmarking tools
   - Determinism validation tools

3. **Documentation improvements**
   - Update all design docs with implementation details
   - Add test examples to documentation
   - Create component interaction diagrams

### Success Metrics

- **Test Coverage**: >95% for critical components
- **Documentation Accuracy**: All examples validated by tests
- **Performance**: No regressions in hot paths
- **Determinism**: 100% replay stability
- **Development Velocity**: Maintained or improved
