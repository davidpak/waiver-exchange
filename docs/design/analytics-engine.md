# AnalyticsEngine Design Document

## 1. Overview

The `AnalyticsEngine` is a dedicated analytics and observability service that provides comprehensive monitoring, metrics collection, and historical analysis for the Waiver Exchange system. It serves as the central hub for all system analytics, offering a **one-stop shop** for production monitoring, performance analysis, and operational insights.

The AnalyticsEngine operates as an **independent service** that subscribes to events from the `ExecutionManager`, aggregates metrics in real-time, and stores structured data in a columnar format for efficient querying and analysis. It provides both real-time monitoring capabilities and historical trend analysis to support production operations, capacity planning, and system optimization.

### Role in the System

The AnalyticsEngine sits **downstream** of the `ExecutionManager` in the event processing pipeline:

- **Ingest:** Consumes structured analytics events from `ExecutionManager` via protobuf
- **Aggregate:** Processes and aggregates metrics in real-time with configurable sampling
- **Store:** Persists data in Parquet format with tiered retention policies
- **Query:** Provides CLI interface for analytics queries and system monitoring
- **Alert:** Monitors thresholds and sends notifications (future enhancement)

### Core Responsibilities

- **Real-time Metrics Collection:** Capture performance, business, and operational metrics
- **Historical Data Storage:** Maintain time-series data with efficient columnar storage
- **Analytics Interface:** Provide CLI tools for system monitoring and analysis
- **Data Retention Management:** Implement tiered retention policies for cost optimization
- **System Health Monitoring:** Track system health, errors, and performance degradation
- **Capacity Planning Support:** Provide data for scaling and resource planning decisions

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Event Ingestion

**Input Sources:**
- `ExecutionManager` analytics events via protobuf
- System health events from all components
- Performance metrics from Whistle engines
- Business metrics from trading activity

**Event Types:**
- **Performance Events:** Tick duration, latency, queue depths, resource utilization
- **Business Events:** Orders processed, trades executed, volume, active users
- **System Health Events:** Crashes, errors, backpressure, memory issues
- **Operational Events:** Symbol lifecycle, thread utilization, I/O metrics

**Sampling Strategy:**
- **Time-based:** Emit events every 1 second (configurable)
- **Tick-based:** Emit every 100 ticks (configurable)
- **Event-driven:** Emit on significant events (crashes, errors, high latency)
- **Adaptive:** Adjust sampling rate based on system load

### 2.2 Data Aggregation

**Real-time Processing:**
- **Streaming aggregation** of metrics within time windows
- **Rolling averages** for performance indicators
- **Percentile calculations** (P50, P95, P99, P99.9) for latency metrics
- **Rate calculations** for throughput metrics

**Aggregation Windows:**
- **1-second windows:** Real-time monitoring
- **1-minute windows:** Short-term trends

### 2.3 Data Storage

**Storage Format:**
- **Parquet files** for columnar storage efficiency
- **Partitioned by time** (hourly/daily partitions)
- **Compressed** for storage optimization
- **Schema evolution** support for future enhancements

**Data Tables:**
- **performance_metrics:** Tick duration, latency, resource usage
- **business_metrics:** Trading activity, volume, user counts
- **system_health:** Errors, crashes, system status
